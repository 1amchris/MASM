# MASM
This is a Microsoft Assembly template for Visual Studio 2017

# How to install the template
  First, download the github to your computer. The only file you will need is the MASM.zip file
  Second, move the MASM.zip file to this location on your computer (assuming you have left default all installation parameters for Visual Studio 2017) : 
    C:\Users\'your user goes here'\Documents\"Visual Studio 2017"\"My Exported Templates"

  That's it!
  
# How to use the template
  Open Visual Studio 2017 and create a new Solution (as some settings will be changed for the whole solution)
  Somewhere in your solution creator you will find a new Template named "MASM". It should be new. Mine is located under C++
  Use this (instead of other parameters) and name your project and your solution as you wish. Now select 'create new' and you'll be ready to code Microsoft Assembly in the main.asm file
  
  Voila!
